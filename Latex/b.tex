\section*{b) The word problem}

In order to describe the formal language that is used in the \texttt{.uwg} file format and to solve the word problem, the alphabet and the language must first be defined. 

The alphabet is $\Sigma_{MFMST}=\{0,1,\dotsc,9,SPACE,LF\}$, where "SPACE"\ is the blank symbol and "LF"\ is the line-feed symbol. 

The language $L_{MFMST,B}$ consists of all inputs whose graph has a mirror-friendly minimum spanning tree $T$ with a mirror $M$ with $max\{|T|,|M|\}\leq B$. In other words, the language is the set of all inputs for which the output is "YES". 

In order to solve the word problem, the problem will be broken into steps. Firstly, the input word $w$ will be read and parsed as a graph, as described in the problem statement. Then some algorithm can be used to give a heuristic of which edges must be or must not be in the optimal solution. Then, check all spanning trees until one with $max\{|T|,|M|\}\leq B$ is satisfied. Then output "YES". If no solution exists, output "NO".
