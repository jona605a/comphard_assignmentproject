# How to run our project
An important prerequisite for your system is to intall rust with the rustup tool: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

In order to run the code, go to the code/ directory and run the command below:
``` sh
$ cargo run --release
```

In order to input a file, run this command:

``` sh
$ cargo run --release < testcases/test01.uwg
```

Change the number for the different test files.
